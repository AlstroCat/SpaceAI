# Space AI Challenge
Code for Space AI Challenge proposal

## Project Breakdown
- `Image Data Preprocessing` Notebook: For pre-proceesing geomagnetic
  image data
- `CNN Model` Notebook: For training a CNN model to predict solar
  wind speed from geomagnetic image data, based on [Raju, H., & Das,
  S. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11207-021-01874-6)
- `dataProcessing/`: It contains the preprocessing of data from other
